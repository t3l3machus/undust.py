# undust.py
undust is a URL pattern generator that helps uncover archived, backup, and temporary files left behind on web servers. Given a URL, it creates common file variants like .bak, .zip, .old, and more. With the -a option, it recursively generates these patterns across all parent directories in the path to maximize coverage.
